# Pipelined_DataPath_Project
This is a repository that contains my project where I created a pipelined data path to run MIPS code. This project was runner-up for one of the quickest projects in the class.


I implemented a FPGA-based full scale pipelined datapath with tradeoff analysis on the joint effects of the hardware, software, and instruction set architecture design realms. I designed, implemented, and validated a five-stage pipelined datapath for the MIPS 32-bit ISA on the Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA. Additionally, I developed a video processing algorithm in MIPS ISA and executed it on the FPGA-based emulation of the pipelined processor.
